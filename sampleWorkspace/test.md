# VS Code Daffodil Debug

Daffodil Debug local_i allows to "debug" markdown files (like this).
The text of the markdown is considered the "program to debug" and certain keywords trigger specific functionality:

* if debugging stops on a line, the line becomes a stack in the CALL STACK with the words shown as frames.
  Here is a long stack trace: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.
* Variables are just synthesized by Daffodil Debug, they do not originate from the markdown file.

## Inline Values

Words of the form local_i ... local_o are treated as variables for which a value is shown at the end of the line.
Some more local_f or local_s.
And the same again: local_i, local_o
And these with different casing: Local_I, LOCAL_S

## Breakpoints:

Breakpoints can be set in the breakpoint gutter of the editor (even before a Daffodil Debug session was started).
If a Daffodil Debug session is active, breakpoints are "validated" according these rules:

* if a line is empty or starts with `+` we don't allow to set a breakpoint but move the breakpoint down
* if a line starts with `-` we don't allow to set a breakpoint but move the breakpoint up
* a breakpoint on a line containing the word `lazy` is not immediately validated, but only after hitting it once.

## Data Breakpoints

Data Breakpoints can be set in the VARIABLES view of the editor (while debugging) if the Debug Session supports these.
Breakpoint should apply on next line if access type is "Read" (Break When Value Is Read)
* local_i_read 
* local_f_read 
* local_s_read 
* local_o_read

Breakpoint should apply on next line if access type is "Write" (Break When Value Changes)
* local_i_write 
* local_f_write 
* local_s_write 
* local_o_write

Breakpoint should apply on next line if access type is "ReadWrite" (Break When Value Is Accessed)
* local_i_readWrite 
* local_f_readWrite 
* local_s_readWrite 
* local_o_readWrite

## Exceptions:

If a line contains the word `exception` or the pattern `exception(name)` an exception is thrown.
To make the debugger stop when an exception is thrown, two "exception options" exist in the BREAKPOINTS view:
- **Named Exception**: if enabled and configured with a condition (e.g. `xxx`) the debugger will break on the `exception(xxx)` pattern.
- **Other Exceptions**: if enabled the debugger will break on the word `exception` and the `exception(...)` pattern.

## Output logging:

* a line with the pattern `log(xxx)` logs `xxx` to the debug console. If "xxx" is `start` or `end`, a "log group" is started or ended.

log(start)
log(arbitrary line of text)
log(start)
log(arbitrary line of text level 2)
log(start)
log(arbitrary line of text level 3)
log(start)
log(arbitrary line of text level 4)
log(start)
log(arbitrary line of text level 5)
log(another line of text level 5)
log(end)
log(another line of text level 4)
log(end)
log(another line of text level 3)
log(end)
log(another line of text level 2)
log(end)
log(another line of text)
log(end)
